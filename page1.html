                <h3><font color=#EED522>Case 1: Medicine as a Means for Colonialism — Algerian War of Independence</font></h3>
                <p>The Algerian War of Independence (1954—1962) between French colonial forces and the National
                Liberation Front (FLN) — which was the nationalist political party leading the movement for
                independence— does not at first glance indicate any relation between the two opposing forces
                in their political discourse and the use of medicine. Many accounts have depicted this conflict
                as a strictly military affair, wrought with physical violence and political strategies from both
                sides to attain power.</p>

                    <h5><center>Answer: D) All of the Above</center></h5>
                    <p>Research as published in Jennifer Johnson’s The Battle for Algeria that involved acquiring
                    information from Algerian sources, demonstrates that “the fight between the two sides was not simply
                    a military affair; it also involved diverse and competing claims about how was positioned to better
                    care for the Algerian people’s health and welfare.”</p>

                    <left><p>Winning the support of the residing population is essential in the fight for sovereignty, and both sides
                    understood that demonstrations of military power through wars and physical can only do so much good before causing
                    harm in this fight.  In order to counterbalance the terror and stress inflicted on the residing population from the
                    military violence, the combating forces needed to somehow show the people that they also are capable of caring for them,
                    protecting them, and safeguarding their health. This can only be done through abstracting medical practice to serve their
                    own political agendas in their war efforts. For this reason, the nationalist leadership constructed national health care-institutions
                    that provided care for the population to demonstrate that they were able to effectively care for their own people. This
                    ultimately contributed to obtaining international recognition of Algerian sovereignty.</p></left>

                    <p>Despite losing the war, the French also used medicine and health care to try to secure
                    the support of the population through the establishment of the Sections Administratives Spécialisées (SAS)
                    — “the most comprehensive wartime initiative, aimed to facilitate political rapprochement between the Algerian
                    population and the colonial state.” This initiative involved sending physicians, nurses, and other
                    medical personnel as political ambassadors to rural areas to provide free care, and ultimately to
                    “conquer with medicine rather than bullets.”</p>

                        <p><left>In this way, medicine not only in the context of Algeria but around the world, can serve political purposes whether
                        intended or not — the care that people receive from their medical practitioners forms their ideas of how reliable
                        and effective the political institutions leading their country are by measuring the care they individually receive
                        and the quality of life they are able to attain under their rule. This inevitable relation that links medical
                        practitioners to politics makes it hard for the medical field to remain apolitical, and necessitates that practitioners
                        have a strong awareness of the political environment in which they practice, in addition to the medical science that
                        they need to deliver proper care.</left></p>

                <h3><font color=#EED522>Case 2:Weaponizing Medicine to Cripple a Nation — U.S. Occupation of Iraq</font></h3>
                <p>The idea of compromising the ethics of medicine by politicizing its usage is not foreign to U.S. military
                strategists. Under the Bush Administration, laws were established during the Global War on Terror to allow privately held
                corporations to “rebuild” Iraq and Afghanistan in ways that ultimately undermined the health and nutrition of local populations.
                This was done through the establishment of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA)— a transitional government in Iraq— which
                privatized the previously state-run Iraqi health care system. This directly affected medical practitioners in Iraq and the care
                they were able to provide as it banned thousands of Iraqi physicians and nurses from public-sector employment. As the U.S. invasion
                in Iraq evolved into long-term occupation, the sectarian political system created by the CPA was met with opposition from the Iraqi
                population, which inevitably caused Iraqi physicians who were working within the CPA’s new health system to be targeted for violence.
                According to Jennifer Terry in her work Attachments to War, this ultimately “contributed to the chaotic conditions that helped plunge
                Iraq into an acute-on-chronic public health emergency, which it still remains in today.” </p>

                    <ol><left>
                        <li>By involving health and medicine in military strategies, nations can be severely crippled as the health
                        of a population is essential to ensuring the stability of a nation.</li>
                        <li>Furthermore, despite efforts to keep hospitals and places of medical care politically neutral, political
                        conflict will still enter the medical sphere, as shown in the example of Iraqi physicians working during the time of U.S. occupation.
                        For this reason, it is important that physicians remain aware of the political environment in which they are serving patients.</li>
