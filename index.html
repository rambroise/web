                <p>Hello premedical students, and welcome to the online learning course —Medical Practice: More than Just Science.
                   As you absorb all the science content you possibly can in the fields of biology, organic chemistry, anatomy and
                   the like, it can be hard for you as students to imagine how your future careers as medical practitioners necessitate
                   any special knowledge and awareness of fields outside of biomedicine and science. The academic environment can sometimes
                   foster the division between being pre-med and being pre-law, creating the idea that medicine and politics are separate
                   domains. However, as you will soon see, this is not the case, as there exists a co-constitutive relationship between
                   medicine and politics, such that medicine shapes politics and the political environment, in turn, also shapes medicine.
                   Thus, in order to be an effective medical practitioner in whatever specialty you choose, there needs to first be established
                   an awareness of medicine’s interdependence on politics.</p>

                <p>In this online module, we will be investigating this co-constitutive relationship between medicine and politics in the
                context of political conflict. In times of political discourse — whether it be in the form of international tensions with
                regard to policies or in the form of full-fledged wars— a nation’s political environment occupies a special role in influencing
                spheres of life, including medicine. As such, it is during these times that the long-existing connections between medicine
                and conflict become most visible. Likewise, given the nature of medical practice as a field concerned with the promoting
                the health, and thus quality of life of individuals, medicine in many ways can have great influence in politics,
                for example, by determining who receives certain qualities of care. Moreover, in times of political conflict, it is not
                uncommon for national leaders to seek medicine as a solution to gaining political power and repairing political relationships.
                All of this will be further explained, shortly in the different sections of this online module.</p>
